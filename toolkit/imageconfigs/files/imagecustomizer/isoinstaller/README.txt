The ISO installer uses an attended_config.json file, generated by the toolkit from a configuration file, 
to facilitate OS installation. Imagecustomizer relies on the ISO installer and requires all necessary files 
including imager, liveinstaller, package list files, and attended_config.json to be present for ISO creation. 
Currently, manual intervention is necessary to update attended_config.json for Azure Linux 64k ISO (attended_config_aarch64_64k.json).
Please note, each package json file should be included under both the ISO and OS sections in the imageconfigs/full-64k-arm64.yaml file.
This will ensure generation of all required RPM packages for ISO installer.
In the future, the Image Customizer tool will support fully automated end-to-end creation of the installer iso.
For guidance on configuring attended_config_aarch64_64k.json, users should reference toolkit/imageconfigs/full-aarch64.json.
